    <h3>From Steve Krug's book "Don't make me think", on accessibility:</h3>
    <h4>Don’t use small, low-contrast type.</h4>
    <p>
      You can use large, low-c ontrast type, or small (well, smallish)
      high-contrast type. But never use small, low-contrast type. (And try to
      stay away from the other two, too.) Unless you’re designing your own
      design portfolio site, and you really, truly don’t care whether anybody
      can read the text or not.
    </p>
    <h4>Don’t put labels inside form fields.</h4>
    <p>
      Yes, it can be very tempting, especially on cramped mobile screens. But
      don’t do it unless all of these are true: The form is exceptionally
      simple, the labels disappear when you start typing and reappear if you
      empty the field, the labels can never be confused with answers, and
      there’s no possibility that you’ll end up submitting the labels along with
      what you type (“Job TiAssistant Managertle”). And you’ve made sure they’re
      completely accessible. If you don’t agree, before you send me email please
      search for “Don’t Put Labels Inside Text Boxes (Unless You’re Luke W)” and
      read it.
    </p>
    <h4>Preserve the distinction between visited and unvisited text links.</h4>
    <p>
      By default, Web browsers display links to pages that you’ve already opened
      in a different color so you can see which options you’ve already tried.
      This turns out to be very useful information, especially since it’s
      tracked by URL, not by the wording of the link. So if you clicked on Book
      a trip, when you see Book a flight later you know that it would take you
      to the same page. You can choose any colors you want, as long as they’re
      noticeably different.
    </p>
    <h4>Don’t float headings between paragraphs.</h4>
    <p>
      Headings should be closer to the text that follows them than the text that
      precedes them.
